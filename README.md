## My process

Once again, 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm starting to learn a bit about flexbox, although it's pretty hard. I'm also building more proficiency with padding and centering things now.

### Continued development

I want to learn even more about flexbox, and I also want to start learning 'best practices' for things that have multiple ways to be done.
